# Face Recognition using VGG-Face Model and GT Database
This project aims to implement a facial recognition system using the VGG-Face model and the GT database. The system will take an image of a face as input, extract the facial features and compare it with the faces stored in the database to identify the person.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
Numpy
OpenCV

# Usage
Enter the name of the person you want to store in the database
Capture an image of the person and store it in the database
Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all the persons you want to store in the database
Enter the name of the person you want to recognize
Capture an image of the person
The system will display the name of the recognized person

# Results
The results of the recognition process can be seen in the terminal window. The system will print the name of the recognized person and the confidence score.

# Acknowledgements
The VGG-Face model has been trained on a large dataset and it is available for use through Keras. The GT database is used to store the images of the persons and their names.

# Conclusion
This project provides a simple implementation of a facial recognition system using the VGG-Face model and the GT database. The system can be used for various applications such as access control, security, and surveillance.
